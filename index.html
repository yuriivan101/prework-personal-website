                <p>Hi, I’m Yuriy Ivanenko, and I am currently working as a Financial Analyst in our Corporate Finance department. 
                    I started with Power 3 years ago during Covid. My former employer 
                    was slowly going out of business, and I had to jump ship to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn’t know anything about this company except that it was rated as a top place 
                    to work in the Philadelphia area. My former company was a small 
                    construction business and didn’t have the best owner. I really wanted to see what a 
                    top-rated company was like, and I have been very pleased with what 
                    I have discovered about Power and the culture here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I started here, I have picked up coding as a problem-solving skill for myself. 
                    I have had many opportunities to apply that skill and help my team to be faster and 
                    more efficient. This has saved every individual hours per week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m a very hands-on individual who likes to do things on his own if possible. 
                    This has manifested itself most prominently with my house DIY projects. 
                    My wife and I bought a fixer-upper house right before Covid. We ended up doing most of 
                    the work ourselves, including remodeling the kitchen and bathrooms. 
                    YouTube has been a great help to me over the years with most housework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important thing that I have learned from coding and 
                    various construction projects is that I can learn and do almost anything.
                </p>
